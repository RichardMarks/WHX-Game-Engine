WHX (pronounce as whicks) is the formal name of the game engine that was started for my 48h2009MiniRPGJamEntry project. 

Source files are located in the ./src/engine/ directory.
Header files are located in the ./include/engine/ directory.

Documentation of the engine can be generated running the doxygen command in the project's root directory.
After running doxygen; docs/web/public_html/ will contain the documentation. 
Open index.html in your web browser to view the documention for the game engine.

SConS is used to build the project.

libwhxge.a will be created in the ./release/ directory
